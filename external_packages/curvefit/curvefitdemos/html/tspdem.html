%% Bivariate Tensor Product Splines
% This demo explains how the spline commands in Curve Fitting Toolbox(TM)
% take advantage of the simple structure of _gridded_ data.

%   Copyright 1987-2010 The MathWorks, Inc.
%   $Revision: 1.1.6.3 $

%% Introduction
% Since Curve Fitting Toolbox can handle splines with _vector_ coefficients, it
% is easy to implement interpolation or approximation to gridded data by
% tensor product splines. Most spline construction commands in the toolbox
% take advantage of this.
%
% However, you might be interested in seeing a detailed description of how
% approximation to gridded data by tensor products is actually done for
% bivariate data.  This will also come in handy when you need some tensor
% product construction not provided by the commands in the toolbox.


%% Example: Least-Squares Approximation to Gridded Data
% Consider, for example, least-squares approximation to given data
%
%    z(i,j) = f(x(i),y(j))   for i = 1:I, j = 1:J.
%
% Here are some gridded data, taken from Franke's sample function. Note that
% the grid is somewhat denser near the boundary, to help pin down the
% approximation there.
x = sort([(0:10)/10,.03 .07, .93 .97]);
y = sort([(0:6)/6,.03 .07, .93 .97]);
[xx,yy] = ndgrid(x,y); % note: ndgrid rather than meshgrid
z = franke(xx,yy);

mesh(x,y,z.');
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y');
view(150,50);
title('Data from the Franke Function');

%% A note about NDGRID vs. MESHGRID
% Note that the statements
%
%    [xx,yy] = ndgrid(x,y);
%    z = franke(xx,yy);
%
% used above make certain that |z(i,j)| is the value of the function being
% approximated at the grid point |(x(i),y(j))|.
%
% However, the MATLAB(R) command |mesh(x,y,z)| expects |z(j,i)| (note the reversed
% order of |i| and |j|) as the value at the grid point |(x(i),y(j))|. For that
% reason, the above plot was generated by the statement
%
%    mesh(x,y,z.');
%
% i.e., using the transpose of the matrix |z|.
%
% Such transposing would not have been necessary had we used |meshgrid|
% instead of |ndgrid|. But the resulting |z| would not have followed
% approximation theory standards.

%% Choice of Spline Space in the Y-Direction
% Next, we choose a spline order |ky| and a knot sequence |knotsy| for the
% y-direction
ky = 3;
knotsy = augknt([0,.25,.5,.75,1],ky);
%%
% and then obtain
sp = spap2(knotsy,ky,y,z);
%%
% a spline curve whose |i|-th component is an approximation to the curve
% |(y,z(i,:))| for |i=1:I|.

%% Evaluation
% In particular,
yy = -.1:.05:1.1;
vals = fnval(sp,yy);
%%
% creates the matrix |vals| whose |(i,j)|-th element can be taken as an
% approximation to the value |f(x(i),yy(j))| of the underlying function
% |f| at the grid point |(x(i),yy(j))|.  This is evident when we plot |vals|.
mesh(x,yy,vals.');
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y');
view(150,50);
title('Simultaneous Approximation to All Curves in the Y-Direction');

%%
% Note that, for each |x(i)|, both the first two and the last two values
% are zero since both the first two and the last two sites in |yy| are
% outside the basic interval for the spline |sp|.
%
% Also note the "ridges" that run along the y-direction, most noticeable near
% the peaks of the surface. They confirm that we are plotting smooth curves in
% one direction only.

%% From Curves to a Surface; Choosing a Spline Space in the X-Direction
% To get an actual surface, we now have to go one step further. Consider the
% coefficients |coefsy| of the spline |sp|, as obtained by
coefsy = fnbrk(sp,'c');
%%

% with the |i|-th element, |coefsy(i,r)|, of the vector coefficient |coefsy(:,r)|

% the same appropriate knot sequence |knotsx| for every |r|.
kx = 4;
knotsx = augknt(0:.2:1,kx);

%%
% The use of the |spap2| command here needs, perhaps, an explanation.
%
% Recall that |spap2(knots,k,x,fx)| treats |fx(:,j)| as the value at |x(j)|,
% i.e., takes each _column_ of |fx| as a data value. Since we wanted to fit
% the value |coefsy(i,:)| at |x(i)|, for all |i|, we have to provide |spap2|
% with the _transpose_ of |coefsy|.

%%
% Now consider the _transpose_ of the coefficient matrix of the resulting spline
% "curve" |sp2|, obtained as
coefs = fnbrk(sp2,'c').';
%%
% |coefs| provides the _bivariate_ spline approximation

%% Why Does This Evaluation Work?
% The statement
%
%    values = spcol(knotsx,kx,xv) * coefs * spcol(knotsy,ky,yv).'
%
% used above makes good sense since, for example, |spcol(knotsx,kx,xv)| is the matrix
% whose |(i,q)|-th entry equals the value |B_{q,kx}(xv(i))| at |xv(i)| of the |q|-th
% B-spline of order |kx| for the knot sequence |knotsx|, while we want to evaluate
% the expression
%
%    sum  sum  coefs(q,r) B_{q,kx}(x) B_{r,ky}(y)
%     q    r
%                       = sum  sum  B_{q,kx}(x) coefs(q,r) B_{r,ky}(y)
%                          q    r
%%
% at |(x,y) = (xv(i),yv(j))|.

%% More Efficient Alternatives
% Since the matrices |spcol(knotsx,kx,xv)| and |spcol(knotsy,ky,yv)| are
% banded, it may be more efficient for "large" |xv| and |yv| (though perhaps
% more memory-consuming) to make use of |fnval|.
value2 = fnval(spmak(knotsx,fnval(spmak(knotsy,coefs),yv).'),xv).';

%%
% In fact, |fnval| and |spmak| can deal directly with multivariate splines,
% hence the above statement can be replaced by
value3 = fnval( spmak({knotsx,knotsy},coefs), {xv,yv} );

%%
% Better yet, the construction of the approximation can be done by _one_
% call to |spap2|, therefore we can obtain these values directly from the
% given data by the statement
value4 = fnval( spap2({knotsx,knotsy},[kx ky],{x,y},z), {xv,yv} );

%% Check it Out
% Here is a check, specifically, the _relative_ difference between the values
% computed in these four different ways.
diffs = abs(values-value2) + abs(values-value3) + abs(values-value4);
max(max(diffs)) / max(max(abs(values)))
%%
% The four methods return the same values, up to round-off error.

%% Error of the Approximation
% Here is a plot of the error, i.e., the difference between the given data
% value and the value of the spline approximation at those data sites.
errors = z - spcol(knotsx,kx,x)*coefs*spcol(knotsy,ky,y).';

title('Error at the Given Data Sites');

%%
% The _relative_ error is
max(max(abs(errors))) / max(max(abs(z)))

%%
% This is perhaps not too impressive. On the other hand, the ratio
%
%  (degrees of freedom used) / (number of data points)
%
% is only
numel(coefs)/numel(z)

%% Apparent Bias of This Approach
% The approach followed here seems |biased|:  We first think of the given data
% values |z| as describing a vector-valued function of |y|, and then we treat
% the matrix formed by the vector coefficients of the approximating curve as
% describing a vector-valued function of |x|.
%
% What happens when we take things in the opposite order, i.e., think of |z|
% as describing a vector-valued function of |x|, and then treat the matrix
% made up from the vector coefficients of the approximating curve as
% describing a vector-valued function of |y|?
%
% Perhaps surprisingly, the final approximation is the same, up to roundoff.
% The next section contains the numerical experiment confirming that.

%% Doing It the Other Way Around: Start With a Spline Space in X
% First, we fit a spline curve to the data, but this time with |x| as the
% independent variable, hence it is the _rows_ of |z| which now become the
% data values. Correspondingly, we must supply |z.'| (rather than |z|) to
% |spap2|, and obtain
spb = spap2(knotsx,kx,x,z.');
%%
% a spline approximation to all the curves |(x,z(:,j))| for |j=1:J|.
% In particular,
valsb = fnval(spb,xv).';
%%
% creates a matrix whose |(i,j)|-th element can be taken as an approximation
% to the value |f(xv(i),y(j))| of the underlying function |f| at the grid
% point |(xv(i),y(j))|.  This is evident when we plot |valsb|.
mesh(xv,y,valsb.');
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y');
view(150,50);
title('Simultaneous Approximation to All Curves in the X-Direction');

%%
% Again note the ridges, this time running along the x-direction. They confirm
% that, once again, we are plotting smooth curves in one direction only.

%% From Curves to a Surface: Using a Spline Space in the Y-Direction
% Now comes the second step, to get the actual surface.
%
% Let |coefsx| be the coefficients for |spb|, i.e.,
coefsx = fnbrk(spb,'c');

%%
% Abstractly, you can think of the spline |spb| as the vector-valued function
%
%    x |REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> sum  coefsx(r,:) B_{r,kx}(x)
%            r
%
% with the |j|-th entry |coefsx(r,j)| of the vector coefficient |coefsx(r,:)|
% corresponding to |y(j)|, for all |j|.  Thus, we now fit each curve
% |(y,coefsx(r,:))| by a spline, using the same order |ky| and the same
% appropriate knot sequence |knotsy| for each |r|.
spb2 = spap2(knotsy,ky,y,coefsx.');

%%
% In the construction of |spb2|, we again need to transpose the coefficient
% matrix from |spb|, since |spap2| takes the columns of its last input
% argument as the data values.
%
% For this reason, there is now no need to transpose the coefficient matrix
% |coefsb| of the resulting "curve".
coefsb = fnbrk(spb2,'c');

%%
% Claim: |coefsb| equals the earlier coefficient array |coefs|, up to round-off.
% For a proof of this, see the discussion of the tensor product construct in 
% Curve Fitting Toolbox documentation. Here, we simply make the following check.
max(max(abs(coefs - coefsb)))

%%
% Thus, the _bivariate_ spline approximation
%
%    (x,y) |REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> sum  sum  coefsb(q,r) B_{q,kx}(x) B_{r,ky}(y)
%                q    r
%
% to the original data
%
%    (x(i),y(j)) |REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH>  f(x(i),y(j)) = z(i,j)
%
% obtained coincides with the earlier one, which generated |coefs| rather than
% |coefsb|.

%%
% As observed earlier, you can carry out the entire construction we
% just went through (in two ways), using just two statements, one for the
% construction of the least-squares approximant, the other for its evaluation
% at a rectangular mesh.
tsp = spap2({knotsx,knotsy},[kx,ky],{x,y},z);
valuet = fnval(tsp,{xv,yv});
%%
% Here, as another check, is the relative difference between the values
% computed earlier and those computed now:
max(max(abs(values-valuet))) / max(max(abs(values)))


%% Another Example: Interpolation
% Since the data come from a smooth function, we should be interpolating
% it, i.e., using |spapi| instead of |spap2|, or, equivalently, use |spap2|
% with the appropriate knot sequences. For illustration, here is the same
% process done with |spapi|.
%
% To recall, the (univariate) data sites were
x
%%
y

%%
% We use again quadratic splines in |y|, hence use knots midway between data
% sites.
knotsy = augknt( [0 1 (y(2:(end-2))+y(3:(end-1)))/2 ], ky);
spi = spapi(knotsy,y,z);
coefsy = fnbrk(spi,'c');

%% Interpolation of Resulting Coefficients
% We use again cubic splines in |x|, and use the not-a-knot condition.  We
% therefore use all but the second and the second-to-last data points as knots.
knotsx = augknt(x([1,3:(end-2),end]), kx);
spi2 = spapi(knotsx,x,coefsy.');
icoefs = fnbrk(spi2,'c').';

%% Evaluation
% We are now ready to evaluate the interpolant
ivalues = spcol(knotsx,kx,xv)*icoefs*spcol(knotsy,ky,yv).';
%%
% and plot the interpolant at a fine mesh.
mesh(xv,yv,ivalues.');

title('The Spline Interpolant');

%%
% Again, the steps above can be carried out using just two statements, one for
% the construction of the interpolant, the other for its evaluation at a
% rectangular mesh.
tsp = spapi({knotsx,knotsy},{x,y},z);
valuet = fnval(tsp,{xv,yv});

%%
% For a check, we also compute the relative difference between the values
% computed earlier and those computed now.
max(max(abs(ivalues-valuet))) / max(max(abs(ivalues)))

%% Error of the Approximation
% Next, we compute the error of the interpolant as an approximation to the
% Franke function.
