function g = fnxtr(f,order)
%FNXTR Extrapolate function
%
%   G = FNXTR(F, ORDER) returns the spline (in ppform) that agrees with 
%   F on the latter's basic interval but is a polynomial of the given ORDER 
%   outside it, with 2 the default for ORDER, in such a way that G satisfies
%   at least ORDER smoothness conditions at the ends of F's basic interval, 
%   i.e., at the new breaks.
%
%   F must be in B-form, BBform, or ppform.
%
%   While ORDER can be any nonnegative integer, FNXTR is useful mainly for
%   0 < ORDER < order of F.
%   If ORDER is zero, then G describes the same spline as FN2FM(F,'B-') but
%   is in ppform and has a larger basic interval.
%   If ORDER is at least as big as F's order, then G describes the same pp as
%   FN2FM(F,'pp') but uses two more pieces and has a larger basic interval.
%
%   If F is m-variate, then ORDER may be an m-vector, in which case ORDER(i) 
%   specifies the matching order to be used in the i-th variable, i=1:m.
%
%   If ORDER < 0, then G is exactly the same as FN2FM(F,'pp'). This unusual
%   option is useful when, in the multivariate case, extrapolation is to take
%   place in only some but not all variables.
%   
%   For example, the cubic smoothing spline for given data x,y is, like any
%   other `natural' cubic spline, required to have zero second derivative 
%   outside the interval spanned by the data sites.  Hence, if such spline is 
%   to be evaluated outside that interval, it should be constructed as
%   s = fnxtr(csaps(x,y),2). The following figure shows the difference:
%
%      x = rand(1,21); s = csaps(x,x.^3); sn = fnxtr(s,2);
%      fnplt(s,[-.5 1.4]), hold on, fnplt(sn,[-.5 1.4],.5,'r'), hold off
%      legend('cubic smoothing spline','... properly extrapolated')
%
%   As bivariate examples,
%
%      fnplt(fnxtr(spmak({0:3,0:4},1),[3,4]))
%
%   shows the full-order extrapolation of a tensor product B-spline, while
%
%      fnplt(fnxtr(spmak({0:3,0:4},1),[3,-1]))
%
%   shows suppression of such extrapolation in the second variable.

      %    ppm := fnxtr1(ppm,ORDER(m)) 
      % is the appropriately extrapolated pp of that last variable
      % (assuming that ORDER(m)>=0 ).
      % Now we want to extrapolate this as a function of the second-last
      % variable. For this, we cyclically permute the M dimensions, making
      % the last one the first but making no other permutations. This requires
      % the permutation  coefs = permute(coefs,[1,M+1,2:M]) and changes,

      % To be sure, application of FNXTR will have changed L(m) (but not K(m))
      % and will have changed BREAKS{m}, and this change has to be accounted
      % for.
      % One now cycles in this manner through the M dimensions, from last to
      % first, ending up with a pp in which, once again, the M variables
      % correspond exactly to the original M variables. That is the beauty of
