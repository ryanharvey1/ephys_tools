%FNZEROS Find zeros of a function in given interval
%
%   Z = FNZEROS(F,[A B]) is an ordered list of the zeros of the univariate
%   spline F in the interval [A .. B]. 
%
%   Z = FNZEROS(F) is a list of the zeros in the basic interval of the spline F.
%
%   A spline zero is either a maximal closed interval over which the spline is
%   zero or a zero crossing (a point across which the spline changes sign). 
%
%   The list of zeros, Z, is a matrix with two rows, the first row is the left
%   endpoint of the intervals and the second row is the right endpoint. Thus,
%   each column Z(:,J) contains the left and right endpoint of a single
%   interval. These intervals are of three kinds:   
%
%   * If the endpoints are different, then the function is zero on the entire
%   interval. In this case the maximal interval is given, regardless of knots
%   that may be in the interior of the interval.  
% 
%   * If the endpoints are the same and coincident with a knot, then the
%   function in f has a zero at that point. The spline could cross zero, touch
%   zero or be discontinuous at this point.  
%
%   * If the endpoints are the same and not coincident with a knot, then the
%   spline has a zero crossing at this point. 
%
%   If the spline, F, touches zero at a point that is not a knot but does not
%   cross zero, then this zero may not be found. If it is found, then it may be
%   found twice.  
%
%   Examples:
%   The quadratic polynomial (x-1)^2 =x^2-2*x+1  has a double zero at x = 1;
%   correspondingly, the command
%
%      fnzeros( ppmak( [0 2.1], [1 -2 1] ) )
%
%   returns a matrix that is nearly ones(2,2). 
%
%   Because the minimum of a univariate scalar function must be at a zero of its
%   derivative or at the ends of the interval of interest, we can use FNZEROS to
%   find the minimum value of a spline. For example,
%
%      % An example spline
%      f = spmak( 1:21, rand( 1, 15 )-0.5 ); 
%      % The interval of interest is the basic interval
%      interval = fnbrk( f, 'interval' );
%      % Find zeros of the derivative
%      z = fnzeros( fnder( f ) );
%      % Because f and its derivative have no repeated knots, the zeros can
%      % only be points
%      z = z(1,:);
%      % Evaluate the spline at the ends of the basic interval and the zeros of
%      % the derivative.
%      values = fnval( f, [interval, z] );
%      % The minimum of these values is the minimum value of the spline.
%      min( values )
%
