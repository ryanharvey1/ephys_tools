%SPAP2 Least squares spline approximation.
%
%   SPAP2(KNOTS,K,X,Y)  returns the B-form of the least-squares approximation
%   f  to the data X, Y by splines of order K with knot sequence KNOTS.  
%   The spline approximates, at the data site X(j), the given data value
%   Y(:,j), j=1:length(X).
%   The data values may be scalars, vectors, matrices, or even ND-arrays.
%   Data points with the same site are replaced by their (weighted) average.
%   
%    f  is the spline of order K with knot sequence KNOTS for which
%
%   (*)    Y = f(X)
%
%   in the mean-square sense, i.e., the one that minimizes
%
%   (**)   sum_j W(j) |Y(:,j) - f(X(j))|^2 ,
%
%   with  W = ones(size(X)). Other weights can be specified by an optional
%   additional argument, i.e., by using
%
%   SPAP2(KNOTS,K,X,Y,W) which returns the spline  f  of order K with knot
%   sequence KNOTS that minimizes (**). A better choice than the default
%   W = ones(size(X))  would be the composite trapezoid rule weights 
%   W = ([dx;0]+[0;dx]).'/2 , with dx = diff(X(:))  (assuming that X is
%   strictly increasing).
%
%   If the data sites satisfy the Schoenberg-Whitney conditions
%
%   (***)   KNOTS(j) < X(j) < KNOTS(j+K) ,
%                               j=1:length(X)=length(KNOTS)-K ,
%
%   (with equality permitted at knots of multiplicity K), then  f  is
%   the unique spline of that order satisfying  (***)  exactly.  No
%   spline is returned unless (***) is satisfied for some subsequence
%   of X.
%   
%   Since it might be difficult to supply such a knot sequence for the given
%   data sites, it is also possible to specify KNOTS as a positive integer,
%   in which case, if possible, a knot sequence will be supplied that satisfies
%   (***) for some subsequence of X and results in a spline consisting of KNOTS 
%   polynomial pieces.
%
%   If Y is a matrix or, more generally, an ND array, of size [d1,...,ds,n] say,
%   then Y(:,...,:,j) is the value being approximated at X(j), and the
%   resulting spline is correspondingly [d1,...,ds]-valued. In that case, the
%   expression  |Y(:,j) - f(X(j))|^2  in the error measure (**) is meant as
%   the sum of squares of all the d1*...*ds entries of  Y(:,j)-f(X(j)) .
%   
%   It is also possible to fit to gridded data:
%
%   SPAP2( {KNOTS1,...,KNOTSm}, [K1,...,Km], {X1,...,Xm}, Y ) returns
%   the m-variate tensor-product spline of coordinate order Ki and with knot 
%   sequence KNOTSi in the i-th variable, i=1,...,m, for which
%
%   Y(:,...,:,i1,...,im) = f(X1(i1),...,Xm(im)),  all i := (i1,...,im) 
%
%   in the (possibly weighted) mean-square sense.
%   Note the possibility of fitting to vector-valued and even ND-valued data.
%   However, in contrast to the univariate case, if the data to be fitted are
%   scalar-valued, then the input array Y is permitted to be m-dimensional,
%   in which case
%   Y(i1,...,im) = f(X1(i1),...,Xm(im)),  all i := (i1,...,im) 
%   in the (possibly weighted) mean-square sense.
%
%   Example 1:
%
%      spap2(augknt(x([1 end]),2),2,x,y);
%
%   provides the least-squares straight-line fit to data x,y, assuming that
%   all the sites x(j) lie in the interval [x(1) .. x(end)], while
%
%      spap2(1,2,x,y);
%
%   accomplishes this without that assumption, and, with that assumption,
%
%      w = ones(size(x)); w([1 end]) = 100;
%      spap2(1,2,x,y,w);
%
%   forces that fit to come very close to the first and last data point.
%
%   Example 2: The statements
%
%      x = -2:.2:2; y=-1:.25:1; [xx, yy] = ndgrid(x,y); 
%      z = exp(-(xx.^2+yy.^2)); 
%      sp = spap2({augknt([-2:2],3),2},[3 4],{x,y},z);
%      fnplt(sp)
%
%   produce the picture of an approximant to a bivariate function. 
%   Use of MESHGRID instead of NDGRID here would produce an error.
