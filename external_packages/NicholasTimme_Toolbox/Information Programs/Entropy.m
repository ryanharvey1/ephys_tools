function [ENT] = Entropy(CountsMat)
%Entropy calculates the entropy in bits of all the variables in CountsMat.
%   [ENT] = Entropy(CountsMat) is the entropy of the variables in CountsMat
%   considered as a single vector valued variable. It does not
%   differentiate between the X and Y variables.
%
%   Inputs
%
%   CountsMat: An array that contains the counts (or joint probability 
%   values) of the various states of the variables. The first index 
%   corresponds to the state of the Y variable. The second through N+1 
%   indexes correspond to the states of the X1 to XN variables. 
%
%   Outputs
%
%   ENT: Entropy
