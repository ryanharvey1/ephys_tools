%% Or use the routine below to make a comodulogram using ModIndex_v1; this takes longer than
%% the method outlined above using ModIndex_v2 because in this routine multiple filtering of the same
%% frequency range is employed (the Amp frequencies are filtered multiple times, one
%% for each phase frequency). This routine might be the only choice though
%% for computers with low memory, because it does not create the matrices
%% AmpFreqTransformed and PhaseFreqTransformed as the routine above
