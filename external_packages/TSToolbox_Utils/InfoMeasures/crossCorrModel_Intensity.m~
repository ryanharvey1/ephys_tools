function  f = crossCorrModel_Intensity(preTrain,postTrain,preTest,params)

% Computes the cross-validated intensity of a spike train given a (predictor) spike train in a
% gaussian temporal window.

%  USAGE
%
%    L = crossCorrModel_Likelihood(preTrain,postTrain,preTest,postTest,binT,params)
%
%    preTrain       pre-synaptic unsmoothed binned spike train from training set
%    postTrain      post-synaptic unsmoothed binned spike train from training set
%    preTest        pre-synaptic unsmoothed binned spike train from test set
%    postTest       post-synaptic unsmoothed binned spike train from test set
%    binT           bn size (in seconds)
%    params         vector of mean (1st element) and s.d. (2nd element) of
%                   the gaussian window
