Circular-circular correlation

   Sum of embedded (4-variate) multiple canonical correlations
   Ref.: Mardia and Jupp, 2000, p. 248 - 249
   Large-sample approximation
     Estimated sum correlations (Rsquared) =    0.439
     Test statistic =    9.2202
     Significance level: alfa = 0.050
     Test criterion (cutoff) =    9.4877
     Cannot reject hypothesis of no association
     P-value = 0.0558
     NOTE: Test and P-value approximate (small N)

   Test distribution based on resampling
   Ref.: Fisher, 1993, p. 214 - 218
     Estimated sum correlations (Rsquared) =   0.439
     Significance level: alfa = 0.050
     Test criterion (cutoff) =   0.458

   T-monotonic rank-correlation association
   Note: Test is sensitive to ties in azimuth data

          Mardia and Jupp, 2000, p. 252
   Large-sample approximation to test distribution
     Estimated correlation (PIhatN) =    0.24
     Test statistic =    4.8076
     Significance level: alfa = 0.050
     Test criterion (cutoff) =    2.3955
     Reject hypothesis of no association
     NOTE: Test is approximate due to small sample

   Test distribution based on resampling
