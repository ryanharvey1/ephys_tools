To install the nSTAT toolbox:
1) Copy the files to the directory of your choice, e.g. c:\nSTAT\
2) Within Matlab, go the directory where you have copied the files
   e.g. >> cd('c:\nSTAT\');
3) type nSTAT_Install from the matlab command prompt
   e.g. >> nSTAT_Install
   This step adds nSTAT to the matlab search path and makes the helpfiles
   searchable along with all other matlab functions
4) Should you wish to install nSTAT in a directory named something other 
   than nSTAT, you will need to add that directory to Matlab's search
   path manually

nSTAT should now appear along with all other installed toolboxes in the
matlab help browser.
