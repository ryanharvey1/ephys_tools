If you run into a bug, are having a problem using the code, or find a feature missing you think should be in the code:

1) [Open an issue](https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode/issues/new). 
This will send an email to everyone following the repository so they can comment on the issue - maybe someone else has had it before.

2) (a) If you know how to address the issue, please do it on your fork. 
Try to do so in a way that will make it easy for others to use. Don’t worry if it’s not perfect, better to improve things slowly but surely, rather than not at all. The issue page is a good forum to discuss with other users how you can best address the issue. 

2) (b) If you don’t know how to address the issue, maybe someone else does. We ask that users do their best to pay attention to new issues and help new users to become comfortable with the code, and contribute to making improvements as they’re needed. The best way the code improves is when someone finds they can’t do something, if everyone pitches in to help them and thus any future users (yourself included) who might want to do that thing.

3) [Open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). 
This gives others a chance to look over your new code for some quality control - maybe they know of something that will break that you don’t - before we pull it into the repository for everyone to use.
