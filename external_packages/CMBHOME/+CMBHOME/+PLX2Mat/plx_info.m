% INPUT:
%   filename - if empty string, will use File Open dialog
%   fullread - if 0, reads only the file header
%              if 1, reads the entire file
% OUTPUT:
%   tscounts - 2-dimensional array of timestamp counts for each unit
%      tscounts(i, j) is the number of timestamps for channel j-1, unit i
%                                (see comment below)
%   wfcounts - 2-dimensional array of waveform counts for each unit
%     wfcounts(i, j) is the number of waveforms for channel j-1, unit i
%                                (see comment below)
%   evcounts - 1x512 array of external event counts
%     evcounts(i) is the number of events for event channel i
%
% Note that for tscounts, wfcounts, the unit,channel indices i,j are off by one. 
% That is, for channels, the count for channel n is at index n+1, and for units,
%  index 1 is unsorted, 2 = unit a, 3 = unit b, etc
% The dimensions of the tscounts and wfcounts arrays are
%   (NChan+1) x (MaxUnits+1)
% where NChan is the number of channel headers in the plx file, and
% MaxUnits is 4 if fullread is 0, or 26 if fullread is 1. This is because
% the header of a .plx file can only accomodate 4 units, but doing a
% fullread on the file may show that there are actually up to 26 units
% present in the file.
