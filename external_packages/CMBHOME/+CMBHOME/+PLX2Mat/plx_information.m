% INPUT:
%   filename - if empty string, will use File Open dialog

% OUTPUT:
% OpenedFileName    - returns the filename (useful if empty string is passed as filename)
% Version -  version code of the plx file format
% Freq -  timestamp frequency for waveform digitization
% Comment - user-entered comment
% Trodalness - 0,1 = single electrode, 2 = stereotrode, 4 = tetrode
% Number of Points Per Wave - number of samples in a spike waveform
% Pre Threshold Points - the sample where the threshold was crossed
% SpikePeakV - peak voltage in mV of the final spike A/D converter
% SpikeADResBits - resolution of the spike A/D converter (usually 12 bits)
% SlowPeakV - peak voltage of mV of the final analog A/D converter
% SlowADResBits - resolution of the analog A/D converter (usually 12 bits)
% Duration - the duration of the file in seconds
% DateTime - date and time string for the file
