%CountSpikesPerCycle - Count number of spikes per LFP cycle.
%
% Count the number of spikes per cycle in the ongoing oscillatory LFP
% (e.g. during theta).
%
%  USAGE
%
%    [count,used] = CountSpikesPerCycle(spikes,phases)
%
%    spikes         list of spike timestamps
%    phases         instantaneous phases in radians (see <a href="matlab:help Phase">Phase</a>)
%
%  OUTPUT
%
%    count          spike counts in successive cycles
%    used           logical vector indicating which spikes were used
%                   (and which were discarded because they belonged
%                   to incomplete cycles)
