%GetSpikeFeatures - Get spike features.
%
%  USAGE
%
%    features = GetSpikeFeatures(group)
%
%    group          electrode group
%
%  OUTPUT
%
%    features       (timestamp,group,cluster,features...) t-uples.
%
%  NOTE
%
%    Contrary to e.g. GetSpikes, this function retrieves information for all clusters
%    of a given electrode group, rather than from a list of selected units. This is
%    because .fet files are usually very large and it would be very inefficient to
%    repeatedly read the same file for each cluster. It is preferable to load the whole
%    file only once, and then select individual clusters if appropriate.
