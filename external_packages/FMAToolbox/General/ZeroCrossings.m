%ZeroCrossings - Test zero crossings in a given time series.
%
%  This assumes a minimum of 10 samples per positive/negative phase.
%
%  USAGE
%
%    [up,down] = ZeroCrossings(samples,<options>)
%
%    samples        an Nx2 matrix of (timestamp,value) pairs
%
%  OUTPUT
%
%    up             logical indices indicating upward zero crossings
%    down           logical indices indicating downward zero crossings
%
%  NOTE
%
%    This finds the points in the signal closest to the zero crossings
%    (the actual zero crossings may not appear in the time series).
%    Hence, if the signal changes very abruptly, e.g. if X(t)=A
%    and X(t+1)=-A (where A is some large constant), this function
%    will consider index t as a downward zero crossing, although
%    the value A is very different from 0.
