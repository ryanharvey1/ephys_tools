% This script makes metadata.coord containing trajectories with
% coordinates in units of both pixels and centimeters. You need the version
% of MakeCoord that has varargins YDir and rot.
% A coord file contains the idealized trajectory that your rat would take
% along your track (rather than the wobbly one he takes in reality). Do not
% draw your coords to perfectly lie on the 90 degree bends in your track: 
% try to draw a good average of the rat's trajectory. So, if he cuts 
% corners, draw your coords with rounded edges.
%
% convFact is also created here, so add it to the corresponding ExpKeys script.
% Calculating the pixel-to-centimeter conversion factor requires the field 
% ExpKeys.realTrackDims. How to measure this properly is explained in the
% section "convert units to cm" down below.
%
% This script will probably work with other rats for tasks with TWO
% trajectory options. However, make sure you find out the value of
% rotation in [rotation,~] = view when you plot the raw position data.
% This will help you orient the figure so that LEFT and RIGHT are
% intuitively plotted. (Note: choice point might not be applicable for
% certain layouts.)

%% convert units to cm

% You need to know the dimensions of your track, but these dimensions must
% be as if the track fits perfectly into a box that has the same orientation
% as the camera's field of view (the box has to be orthogonal to the field
% of view, or whatever)
