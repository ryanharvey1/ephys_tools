The Matlab program pxd.m illustrates the use of a factorial Maximum Likelihood model in separating the relative influences of location and orientation on cell firing. The sample data files listed below contain spike and dwell-time data from a place cell (files prefixed "pc"), a head-direction cell (hd) and a theta-modulated place by direction cell (tpd), binned by direction and location. The examples relate to the first cell in each figure in the paper, but the way the data are binned and smoothed here is slightly different.
