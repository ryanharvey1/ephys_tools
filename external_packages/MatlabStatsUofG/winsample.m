function [wx,g] = winsample(x,percent)% function [wx,g] = winsample(x,percent)% returns the winsorized sample of x as wx% returns number of winsorized observations at each tail of sample as g% x must be a vector% percent must be between 0 and 100; the function converts the lower and% upper extreme g values of x to x(g+1) and x(n-g), respectively, where% g=floor((percent/100)*length(x)). If x is empty, then NaN is returned. %% Original code provided by Prof. Patrick J.
