function [ W ] = SimGraph( M, Type, Param, varparam )
%SIMGRAPH Returns adjacency matrix for M
%   If M is a square n-by-n matrix, SimGraph returns the
%   adjacency matrix for the similarity graph specified by
%   Type and using the parameter Param, where M is assumed to
%   be the distance matrix.
%   If M is not square, it is assumed to be a d-by-n matrix
%   containing data points. Then, SimGraph also returns the
%   adjacency matrix, but computes it more efficiently.
%
%   The last parameter varparam can either be a scalar, defining
%   the size of neighborhoods when a Gaussian similarity function
%   is applied, or it can be a reference to a function that will
%   be used for weighting the similarity graph (use '@' when
%   calling the function).
%
%   'M' - Matrix either a distance matrix or data points
%   'Type' - Defines type of similarity graph to be used
%      1 - Full Similarity Graph
%      2 - Epsilon Similarity Graph
%      3 - kNearest Neighbors Graph
%      4 - Mutual kNeares Neighbors Graph
%   'Param' - In case of an epsilon graph, this defines epsilon.
%      In case of a kNearest neighbors graph, this defines k.
%   'varparam' (optional) - Either a scalar, defining the size of
%      neighborhoods or a function, calculating the similarities
%      from the distance matrix (has to take arbitrary matrices
%      as the only input and return a matrix of the same size).
