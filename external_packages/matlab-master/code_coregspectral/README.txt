Note
=======
1. All the codes use Gaussian kernel for construction of similarity matrix.

2. Pairwise spectral approach reports the clsutering performance on the first view in each iteration. If you have prior knowledge about which view is more informative about the clusters, use that as the first view.


E.g.

X{1} = X1; X{2} = X2;
sigma(1) = sigma1; sigma(2) = sigma2;
lambda = 0.5; numiter = 5; numClust = 2; num_views = 2;
[F P R nmi avgent AR] = spectral_pairwise_multview(X,num_views,numClust,sigma,lambda,truth,numiter);

The performance measures are reported on X{1} in each iteration in the above function call.

If you want the performance to be reported on X{2} instead, please do as follows:
X{1} = X2; X{2} = X1;
sigma(1) = sigma2; sigma(2) = sigma1;
lambda = 0.5; numiter = 5; numClust = 2; num_views = 2;
[F P R nmi avgent AR] = spectral_pairwise_multview(X,num_views,numClust,sigma,lambda,truth,numiter);


3. Performance can be sensitive to the Lambda value chosen.
