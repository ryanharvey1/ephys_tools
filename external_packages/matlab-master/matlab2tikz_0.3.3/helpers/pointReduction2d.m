function pointReduction2d(minimumPointsDistance)
%   MATLAB2TIKZ('minimumPointsDistance',DOUBLE,...) gives a minimum distance at
%   which two nodes are considered different. This can help with plots that
%   contain a large amount of data points not all of which need to be plotted.
%   (default: 0.0)

%POINTREDUCTION2D    Reduce the number of data points in the plot.
%   POINTREDUCTION2D(minimumPointDistance) reduces the number of data points in the current plot
%   POINTREDUCTION2D comes with several options that can be combined at will.
%
%   POINTREDUCTION2D('figurehandle',FIGUREHANDLE,...) explicitly specifies the
%   handle of the figure that is to be stored. (default: gcf)
%
%   Example
%      x = -pi:pi/1000:pi;
%      y = tan(sin(x)) - sin(tan(x));
%      plot(x,y,'--rs');
%      pointReduction2d(0.1);
