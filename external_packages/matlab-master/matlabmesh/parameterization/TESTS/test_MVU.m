% embed mesh vertices w/ MVU (Maximum Variance Unfolding)
%  [WARNING] this algorithm is very slow even for quite small datasets.
%     I recommend starting MaxIters at something small (10-20) and
%     increasing in small steps. The rightmost column in the output
%     is the error, once it stops changing significantly you can
%     probably stop. In the result output what you want to see
%     is the line 'Partial Success: SDP solved with reduced accuracy'.
%     That seems to be as good as it is going to get...   -RMS
