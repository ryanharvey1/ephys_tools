function [in1,in2,out1,out2,eid1,eid2] = DBMatchValues(eid1,eid2,rexp)

%DBMatchValues - Match values for two different sets of variables.
%
%  It is often necessary to match (associate) variables that were computed
%  independently, e.g. the phase precession slope and field size of hippocampal
%  place cells. Typically, such data are computed over repeated experiments
%  using batch processing tools (see <a href="StartBatch">StartBatch</a>) and stored in databases for
%  subsequent group analyses. Once retrieved using <a href="DBGetValues">DBGetValues</a>, they can be
%  matched using this function.
%
%  USAGE
%
%    [in1,in2,out1,out2,m1,m2] = DBMatchValues(eid1,eid2,rexp)
%
%    eid1,eid2      experiment IDs (see <a href="DBGetValues">DBGetValues</a>)
%    rexp           optional regular expression (see Example 2)
%
%  OUTPUT
%
%    in1            indices of elements in eid1 that are also in eid2
%    in2            indices of elements in eid2 that are also in eid1
%    out1           indices of elements in eid1 that are not in eid2
%    out2           indices of elements in eid2 that are not in eid1
%    m1             matches (extracted patterns) in eid1
%    m2             matches (extracted patterns) in eid2
%
%  EXAMPLE 1
%
%    In this example, place cells were recorded on successive days while the
%    animal explored a maze. Phase precession slopes and firing field sizes
%    were stored in a database using eids like '20120213-Maze-(1,2)' (where 1,2
%    corresponds to tetrode 1, cluster 2) and named 'PPSlope' and 'FieldSize',
%    respectively.
%
%    Get slopes and sizes:
%
%    [slopes,eid1] = DBGetValues('eid like "%Maze%" and name="PPSlope"');
%    [sizes,eid2] = DBGetValues('eid like "%Maze%" and name="FieldSize"');
%
%    Discard values that cannot be correlated (incomplete pairs), and reorder
%    so that each line in both variables corresponds to the same data:
%
%    [in1,in2] = DBMatchValues(eid1,eid2);
%    slopes = slopes(in1);
%    sizes = sizes(in2);
%
%  EXAMPLE 2
%
%    In this example, cells were recorded during both wake an sleep, and their
%    average firing rates should be compared across behavioral conditions.
%    Data were stored in a database using eids like '20120213-Maze-(1,2)' or
%    '20130214-Sleep-(1,2)' and named 'MeanRate'. Matching them is trickier
%    because their eids are not pairwise identical. Here we need to extract
%    the relevant portions of the eids, i.e. discard 'Sleep' or 'Maze'.
%
%    Get mean rates:
%
%    [maze,eid1] = DBGetValues('eid like "%Maze%" and name="MeanRate"');
%    [sleep,eid2] = DBGetValues('eid like "%Sleep%" and name="MeanRate"');
%
%    Discard values that cannot be correlated (incomplete pairs), and reorder
%    so that each line in both variables corresponds to the same data:
%
%    [in1,in2] = DBMatchValues(eid1,eid2,'([0-9]{8}).*([0-9]*,[0-9]*)');
%    maze = maze(in1);
%    sleep = sleep(in2);
%
%    The regular expression includes two tokens (indicated by the parentheses),
%    namely [0-9]{8} (eight successive occurrences of a digit between 0 and 9)
%    and [0-9]*,[0-9]* (any number of digits, a comma, any number of digits).
