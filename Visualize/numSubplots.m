function [p,n]=numSubplots(n)
% function [p,n]=numSubplots(n)
%
% Purpose
% Calculate how many rows and columns of sub-plots are needed to
% neatly display n subplots. 
%
% Inputs
% n - the desired number of subplots.     
%  
% Outputs
% p - a vector length 2 defining the number of rows and number of
%     columns required to show n plots.     
% [ n - the current number of subplots. This output is used only by
%       this function for a recursive call.]
%
%
%
% Example: neatly lay out 13 sub-plots
% >> p=numSubplots(13)
% p = 
%     3   5
% for i=1:13; subplot(p(1),p(2),i), pcolor(rand(10)), end
